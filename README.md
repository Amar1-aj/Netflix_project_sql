# Netflix_project_sql

📊 Netflix Data Analysis Using SQL
📌 Overview
This project performs an in-depth data analysis of Netflix content using PostgreSQL. By running a series of SQL queries on a structured dataset, we explore trends, content distribution, viewer preferences, and key business insights. The analysis helps in answering various strategic and operational questions that could assist content providers, data analysts, and decision-makers at Netflix or similar OTT platforms.

🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

To explore the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows).

To find the most common ratings and content categories.

To analyze content trends across countries and years.

To identify top-performing actors, directors, and genres.

To classify content based on themes like violence or crime.

To derive business insights from structured data for better content strategy.

A total of 15 business questions have been addressed using optimized SQL queries, ranging from simple filtering to complex aggregations and window functions.
